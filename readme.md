## Overview

This project is about building a streamlit app to integrate a trained Generator from a GAN to generate realistic images of a Medical Dataset of Tuberculosis, a minority class in the X ray-Chest Dataset.

* You can Generate Any Number of Images from the Tuberculosis Class by using the streamlit app on this link:
<a></a>
* All you have to do set a number of images to generate and click a button to generate in real time & download a zip file of the images you created.

## Image Dataset Augmentation using GANs

By leveraging the capabilities of GANs, our augmentation technique is now able to generate synthetic images seamlessly integrated with the original dataset.
The objective is to broaden the project and offer the ability to try the generator to generate any number of images a user wants.
The integration of GAN-based augmentation is poised to elevate model performance and adaptability.
